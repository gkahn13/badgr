## Installation

Make sure you have 90GB of space available, [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed, and [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) installed. Our installation was on Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic.

Note: [Docker](#docker) is now available as an alternative to the following system installation. This approach is recommended to avoid dealing with deprecated Python packages. 


Clone the repository and go into the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkahn13/badgr.git
cd badgr
```

From now on, we will assume you are in the badgr folder.

Download the training data tfrecords and sample rosbags from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zjtuqMIfgEbKTZ-H-uHqCKS8RPDoYiwc?usp=sharing), and extract them into the data folder:
```bash
mkdir data
cd data
mv </path/to/BADGR_collision_tfrecords.zip> .
mv </path/to/BADGR_bumpy_tfrecords.zip> .
mv </path/to/BADGR_rosbags.zip> .
unzip BADGR_collision_tfrecords.zip
rm BADGR_collision_tfrecords.zip
unzip BADGR_bumpy_tfrecords.zip
rm BADGR_bumpy_tfrecords.zip
unzip BADGR_rosbags.zip
rm BADGR_rosbags.zip
cd ..
```

Then setup the anaconda environment:
```bash
conda create -y --name badgr python==3.6.9
source activate badgr
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-ros-numpy
```

Add the src directory to your PYTHONPATH:
```bash
echo 'export PYTHONPATH=</path/to/badgr/src>:$PYTHONPATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Training

Open a new terminal and activate the badgr anaconda environment:
```bash
source activate badgr
```

We train two separate neural networks: one that predicts future collisions and positions, and one that predicts bumpy terrain:
```bash
python scripts/train.py configs/collision_position.py
python scripts/train.py configs/bumpy.py
```

These networks are trained separately so that the data can be rebalanced for either equal proportion collision or bumpy labels. However, at test time these models are combined into a single predictive model, which is possible because the models both have the same inputs.

Create the folder for the combined model:
```bash
mkdir data/bumpy_collision_position
```

## Evaluation

First, play the collision rosbag in a loop,
```bash
rosbag play -l data/rosbags/collision.bag
```

set the cost function weights to only account for collisions,
```bash
rosparam set /cost_weights "{'collision': 1.0, 'position': 0.0, 'position_sigmoid_center': 0.4, 'position_sigmoid_scale': 100., 'action_magnitude': 0.01, 'action_smooth': 0.0, 'bumpy': 0.0}"
```

and then start the policy
```bash
python scripts/eval.py configs/bumpy_collision_position.py
```

This will display a visualizer showing the candidate action sequences, predicted probabilities of collision, and the optimal action sequence for purely avoiding collisions.

If you wish to visualize the planner for avoiding bumpy terrain, start the bumpy rosbag in a loop,
```bash
rosbag play -l data/rosbags/bumpy.bag
```

change the cost function,
```bash
rosparam set /cost_weights "{'collision': 0.0, 'position': 0.0, 'position_sigmoid_center': 0.4, 'position_sigmoid_scale': 100., 'action_magnitude': 0.01, 'action_smooth': 0.0, 'bumpy': 1.0}"
```

change the visualizer to show bumpiness by modifying `configs/bumpy_collision_position.py` to have `debug_color_cost_key='bumpy'`, and restart the policy
```bash
python scripts/eval.py configs/bumpy_collision_position.py
```

## Docker

Docker and the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) must be installed before proceeding.

First follow the standard instructions for cloning the repository and downloading the data. In the badgr directory:
```
docker build . -t badgr:1.13.1
```
After building follow the training instructions within a badgr container. Make sure to use `python3` instead of `python` A convenience script `badgr_docker` is included which brings up a container with the proper docker options. Change the volume path if badgr is not installed in your home directory.

With a trained model `bgr.sh` can be run to execute the evaluation demo.


## FAQ
1. If you are having issues with importing OpenCV (e.g., `ImportError: /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv2.so: undefined symbol: PyCObject_Type`), try the following to have python look for the Python 3 OpenCV first:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=<path/to/anaconda/envs>/badgr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH
```
